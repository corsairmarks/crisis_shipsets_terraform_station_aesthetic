[h1]Overview[/h1]
Do you like terraform stations from my mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2622411084]Aesthetic Terraform Stations[/url]?  Do you also want to have properly-skinned terraform stations using the crisis ships (Contingency, Unbidden [i]et al[/i], Prethoryn)?  Then this mod is for you!

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Adds terraform station definitions with an active terraforming beam for for all of the built-in crisis graphical cultures ([b]ai_01[/b], [b]ai_01_blue[/b], [b]extra_dimensional_01[/b], [b]extra_dimensional_02[/b], [b]extra_dimensional_03[/b], [b]swarm_01[/b]), required for Aesthetic Terraform Stations to apply the correct appearance.  Also supports other mods which add shipsets using the crisis models (see below for a list of those currently supported).

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Should work with practically everything that also works with Aesthetic Terraform Stations and one or more of the supported shipset mods.

Built for Stellaris version 3.7 "Canis Minor."  Not compatible with achievements, but neither is the dependency.
